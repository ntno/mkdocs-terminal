The following is a list of all extensions which have been tested with this theme, linking to documentation which explain how they can be used. Suggested Python Markdown Extensions # Attribute Lists # The Attribute Lists extension helps to add HTML attributes and CSS classes to almost every Markdown inline- and block-level element with a special syntax. Enable it via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions: - attr_list No configuration options are available. See reference for usage: Adding buttons Adding tooltips Adding link target Definition Lists # The Definition Lists extension adds the ability to add definition lists (more commonly known as description lists \u2013 dl in HTML) via Markdown to a document. Enable it via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions: - def_list No configuration options are available. See reference for usage: Using definition lists Footnotes # The Footnotes extension enables inline footnotes which are then rendered below all Markdown content of a document. Enable it via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions: - footnotes No configuration options are supported. See reference for usage: Adding footnote markers Adding footnote content Markdown in HTML # The Markdown in HTML extension allows for writing Markdown inside of HTML, which is useful for wrapping Markdown content with custom elements. Enable it via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions: - md_in_html From the Markdown in HTML extension's docs: By default, Markdown ignores any content within a raw HTML block-level element. With the md_in_html extension enabled, the content of a raw HTML block-level element can be parsed as Markdown by including a markdown attribute on the opening tag. The markdown attribute will be stripped from the output, while all other attributes will be preserved. No configuration options are available. See reference for usage: Adding Grouped Buttons Adding Figures Table of Contents # The Table of Contents extension automatically generates a table of contents from a document which Terminal for MkDocs will render as part of the resulting page. It can be configured via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions: - toc: permalink: \"#\" The following configuration options are supported: permalink Default : false This option adds an anchor link containing the paragraph symbol (if true ) or another custom symbol at the end of each headline, exactly like on the page you're currently viewing. permalink_title Default : Permanent link This option sets the title of the anchor link which is shown on hover and read by screen readers. For accessibility reasons, it might be beneficial to change it to a more discernable name, stating that the anchor links to the section itself. Ex: Anchor link to this section for reference toc_depth Default : 6 Defines the range of levels to be included in the table of contents. This may be useful for project documentation with deeply structured headings to decrease the length of the table of contents, or to remove the table of contents altogether. See Table of Contents Example for further discussion. baselevel Default : 1 Base level for headers. See Table of Contents Example for further discussion. anchorlink Default : false Set to true to render all headers as links to themselves. The other configuration options of this extension are not officially supported by Terminal for MkDocs, which is why they may yield unexpected results. Use them at your own risk.
