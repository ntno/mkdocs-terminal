## Block Highlighting

Language highlighting can be enabled with `pymdownx` by adding a [supported programming language](https://pygments.org/languages/) name directly after the first <code>```</code> grouping in a code block:

```python
--8<--
sample-languages/scripts/example.py
--8<--
```

### Block Markdown 

````markdown
```python
--8<--
sample-languages/scripts/example.py
--8<--
```
