# Cobol

## Block Highlighting

Language highlighting can be enabled with Highlight.js by adding a [supported programming language](https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported-languages.html) name directly after the first <code>```</code> grouping in a Markdown code block:

```cobol
--8<--
sample-languages/scripts/example.cbl
--8<--
```

### Block Markdown 

````text
```cobol
--8<--
sample-languages/scripts/example.cbl
--8<--
```
````
