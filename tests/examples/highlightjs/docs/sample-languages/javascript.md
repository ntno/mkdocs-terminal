# Javascript

Javascript language highlighting with Language highlighting can be enabled with `highlight.js` by adding a [supported programming language](https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported-languages.html) name directly after the first <code>```</code> grouping in a code block:

```javascript
let score1 = 2;
let score2 = 5;
let averageScore = (score1 + score2) / 2.0
console.log(averageScore)
```
