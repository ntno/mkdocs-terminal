"""HTML validation tests for Terminal for MkDocs theme.

This module tests that the theme generates valid HTML5 with proper semantic
structure according to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

Test Scope (Theme Only):
- HTML5 validity and structure of theme output
- Semantic element usage in theme (nav, main, aside, article, header, footer)
- Theme template structure and semantic correctness
- Duplicate ID detection in theme-generated elements

Out of Scope (User Content):
- Heading hierarchy (user's responsibility)
- Form labeling (user's responsibility)
- Image alt text (user's responsibility)
- Link text (user's responsibility)
These are content decisions made by site authors, not the theme.
