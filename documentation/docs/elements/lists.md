# Lists
Markdown supports unordered lists, ordered lists, and nested lists.  Nested items must be preceded by 4 spaces.

## Ordered List
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.  

1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item
    1. Indented item
    1. Indented item
1. Fourth item 

### Markdown
```markdown
1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item
    1. Indented item
    1. Indented item
1. Fourth item 
```

## Unordered List
To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items.

* First item
