# Lists 

Markdown supports unordered lists, ordered lists, and nested lists.  Nested items must be preceded by 4 spaces.

## Ordered List
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers donâ€™t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.  

1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item
    1. Indented item
    1. Indented item
1. Fourth item 

### Markdown
