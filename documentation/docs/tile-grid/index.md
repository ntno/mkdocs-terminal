# Terminal for MkDocs Tile Grid

Terminal for MkDocs enables you to quickly create a grid of linked tiles.  Each tile can contain an image, link, and caption.

<section markdown>
<figure markdown>
![Tile Grid Example](../img/tile-grid/overview-example.png){alt="web page with three square images in a row.  images appear after Lorem Ipsum text." .terminal-mkdocs-thin-border }
<figcaption markdown>[Tile Grid Example](./examples/example-page)</figcaption>
</figure>
</section>

To use this feature, complete the following steps:

## 1. Add `tiles` to Page Metadata
Add a [YAML Style Meta-Data] section to the very top of your Markdown page.  The metadata should contain the attribute `tiles` which is a list of YAML objects.  

Pay special attention to the indentation.  There should be two spaces before the `-` marking the start of an object.  There should be four spaces before any additional object attribute:  

```markdown
---
tiles:
  - caption: '@petradr'
    img_src: https://picsum.photos/id/167/200/200
    alt_text: 'close up of fallen leaves.'
  - caption: 'Marcin Czerwinski'
    img_src: https://picsum.photos/id/127/200/200
    alt_text: 'close up of green moss on a log.'
  - caption: 'Steve Richey'
    img_src: https://picsum.photos/id/143/200/200
    alt_text: 'overhead of fallen leaves.'
---

# My Page Content
```

Each tile object may have any of the attributes described in the [Tile Reference](tile.md).


## 2. Add Page to Nav
Add the markdown file which includes the `tiles` metadata to the site's navigation in `mkdocs.yml`.  If the page is not included in the `mkdocs.yml` *nav*, the markdown will not be loaded as a MkDocs Page Object[^mkdocs-page-object] and will not include your metadata.

*Note*: the page does not need to be visible in the final side navigation menu.  Deeply nested pages can also use the tile grid feature.  

```
nav:
    - Home: 'index.md'
    - Example Page: 'tile-grid/examples/example-page.md'
    - Tile Grid:
      - Examples:
        - Also Works: 'tile-grid/examples/example-page.md'
```

## 3. Configure Tile Grid
The Tile Grid can be further configured using the attributes described in the [Grid Reference](grid.md).  For example, the grid can be configured to display before the main page content:

```markdown
---
show_tiles_first: true
tiles:
  - caption: '@petradr'
    ...
```
