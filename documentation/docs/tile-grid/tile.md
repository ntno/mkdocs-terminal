## Alternate Text

> Pages should provide effective text alternatives for screen readers in the form of alt text. When a screen reader encounters an image, it will attempt to read a text alternative.
> 
> Text alternatives are also important when images do not load. Users with cognitive impairments may prefer to disable images from loading. Likewise, images may not load when a user has a slow internet connection. In both cases, the browser will show the image’s alt text.

## Best Practices
- Be brief: less than 100 characters.  
- Avoid “image of”, “photo of”, "screenshot of", etc.
- ==Alternate text for image links should describe the purpose of the link, NOT the image.== 
    - If it is important to describe the image itself, add a description in the caption or in the surrounding text.
- Decorative images should have blank or empty alt text.
