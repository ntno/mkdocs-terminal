## Releases

Terminal for MkDocs uses [semantic versioning].  Each version number is in the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.  Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- the **MAJOR** version increments with an incompatible API change
- the **MINOR** version increments with added functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- the **PATCH** version increments with backwards compatible bug fixes

[semantic versioning]: https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200

We recommend that you pin your dependency on `mkdocs-terminal` to the latest supported major version.  This will prevent you from accidently installing a version of the Terminal for MkDocs theme which is incompatible with your site configuration.

example: `mkdocs-terminal~=4.0`

See [Version Identification and Dependency Specification] for additional constraint examples.
