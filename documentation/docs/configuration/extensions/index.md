# Extensions

Markdown is a very small language with a kind-of reference implementation called
[John Gruber's Markdown]. [Python Markdown] and [PyMdown Extensions] are two packages that enhance the Markdown writing experience, adding useful syntax extensions for technical writing.

# Configuration

Extensions are configured as part of `mkdocs.yml` â€“ the MkDocs configuration
file. The following sections contain two example configurations to bootstrap
your documentation project.

## Minimal Config

This configuration is a good starting point for when you're using Terminal for 
MkDocs for the first time. The best idea is to explore the [suggested extensions](#suggested-extensions) and gradually add what you want to use:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  # Python Markdown  
  - attr_list
  - md_in_html
  - meta
  - toc:
      permalink: "#"
```

## Recommended Config

This configuration enables all Markdown-related features of Terminal for MkDocs
and is great for experienced users bootstrapping a new documentation project:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  # Python Markdown  
  - attr_list
  - def_list
  - footnotes
  - md_in_html
  - meta
  - toc:
      permalink: "#"
      permalink_title: Anchor link to this section for reference

  # PyMdown Extensions
  - pymdownx.caret
  - pymdownx.mark
  - pymdownx.tilde
  - pymdownx.snippets:
      base_path: 
        - docs
```
